To counteract the climate catastrophe and promote biodiversity, it is important to plant mixed forests. We planted poplar, willow, alder, sitka spruce, birch, Murray pine and rowan from the local tree nursery. Why do we fly several thousand kilometres to plant trees? We are asked this again and again. We would very much like to realise more reforestation projects in Germany/Brandenburg. Our motivation is great, but unfortunately it has been slowed down again and again in the past two years. Applying for funding is, as in any German authority, a feat of incredible proportions. Our applications so far have been rejected. Furthermore, we need areas where trees can be planted. In Germany, these are either hard to come by or too expensive. In Iceland, we were given a large area to plant without much effort. In contrast to Germany, there are huge unused areas that can be reforested. Since no fences have to be built around the planted areas in Iceland, you save a lot of money and work. Because it rains a lot and often in Iceland, the trees do not need to be watered. There is also no need to cut back weeds that are too tall, because the areas are hardly overgrown.  90 % of the planted trees will grow. In Germany, usually only 50-60% make it.",

The allocated project budget of 5000 euros was spent almost exclusively on the purchase of trees. With this action we started an attempt to increase the number of trees in our city. Against the background that tree felling in Potsdam is by far not sufficiently compensated by new plantings of city trees, we came up with the idea of giving away native fruit trees to public institutions as well as to private individuals. For our fruit trees planted in youth clubs, children's, school and private gardens, it can be ensured at the same time that the young trees are well cared for and well watered in dry periods. The feedback we received about our campaign was consistently gratifying. The fact of receiving something as a gift, just for a good cause, was met with positive astonishment by many people in Potsdam. Thankfully, some people from Potsdam sent us a photo of the planted fruit trees, so that we can show a small collage here.",

Today, the cooperation between Woods Up and the municipality of Michendorf has resulted in the beginning of a small educational forest, where children in particular can learn a little more about the diversity of tree species. The plantings were made in the Wilhelmshorst play forest between the primary school, day care centre and crèche. From today on, the children and their families can admire the trees every day and also water them regularly. Thank you for the joint kick-off!",

With this, we want to compensate for the loss from last year. The last winter was characterized by unusually strong storms and cold. This has been very hard on the young trees and several hundred have unfortunately not managed to grow. However, about 80% of the trees from 2021 have made it and we are looking forward to continuing the project in 2023.

The artist's wish is 'the more colorful the better'. Two hundred and forty fruit trees of different varieties were planted. Among them three different apple varieties, three pear varieties, three plum varieties, walnut, hazelnut as well as cherry varieties. In addition, about sixty other trees and shrubs were planted. Among others, red oak, ginkgo, birch, beech, fir and spruce. From the neighborhood we have received forty more seedlings as a gift. We would like to thank everyone who supported this project. The wonderful team that worked on site and all the good people who made this project possible with their donations. All nature and art enthusiasts are invited to come to Kreševo once a year to support the project, to exchange creative ideas and to get to know wild Bosnia together.",

            "content": "The Potsdam-based association Woods Up e.V. has completed its first reforestation project this year in Hafnarsandur, Iceland. Together, 10 volunteers planted 35,000 trees, bringing the total number of trees planted since 2020 to more than 100,000. The conditions were harsh and characterized by heavy rain, gale-force winds and cool temperatures. Nevertheless, a total of 35,000 trees were planted within eight days. The association has been involved in Iceland since 2020 and has now been able to plant over 100,000 poplars, willows, birches, rowan trees, Sitka spruces and coastal pines over an area of around 100 hectares thanks to donations. The planted areas are previously unused wasteland, which is why it is not simply a matter of converting existing forests, but of genuinely creating additional forest areas. The association is also active in Iceland, where it is possible to recultivate large areas with a very small budget and without bureaucratic hurdles. The fact that no fencing and no irrigation is required due to the regular rainfall is particularly advantageous. In addition, the land in Iceland does not have to be purchased, but remains in public ownership, which ensures that the social bond is maintained in the long term. Icelandic society has a strong interest in supporting reforestation in order to achieve climate protection goals, stop soil erosion and increase biodiversity. The association can also build on the expertise of Icelandic forestry scientists, who have been researching which tree species thrive on the island for decades. Sitka spruce, for example, has proven its worth and now reaches heights of up to 30 meters there. In Germany, on the other hand, experiments are still being carried out to find out which tree species could survive in the future, and there are also enormous hurdles and challenges in domestic reforestation projects. In addition to the realization of a tiny forest in the Potsdam city area, WoodsUp is planning another project in Iceland for the autumn, which could plant an additional 15,000 trees. The association hopes that the €7,500 required for this will come from donations. The planting team has also been following the current discussion about the demolition of the Staudenhof from afar and has noted with annoyance that the city of Potsdam is sticking to its brutal and climate-damaging building policy. Historicizing backdrops seem to be more important than the declared climate emergency.",
