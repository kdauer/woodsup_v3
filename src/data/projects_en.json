      "content": "At the end of May, a group of five flew to Hafnarsandur, Iceland, to plant about 20,000 trees and cuttings on a 10 ha site. To counteract the climate catastrophe and promote biodiversity, it is important to plant mixed forests. We planted poplar, willow, alder, sitka spruce, birch, Murray pine and rowan from the local tree nursery. Why do we fly several thousand kilometres to plant trees? We are asked this again and again. We would very much like to realise more reforestation projects in Germany/Brandenburg. Our motivation is great, but unfortunately it has been slowed down again and again in the past two years. Applying for funding is, as in any German authority, a feat of incredible proportions. Our applications so far have been rejected. Furthermore, we need areas where trees can be planted. In Germany, these are either hard to come by or too expensive. In Iceland, we were given a large area to plant without much effort. In contrast to Germany, there are huge unused areas that can be reforested. Since no fences have to be built around the planted areas in Iceland, you save a lot of money and work. Because it rains a lot and often in Iceland, the trees do not need to be watered. There is also no need to cut back weeds that are too tall, because the areas are hardly overgrown.  90 % of the planted trees will grow. In Germany, usually only 50-60% make it.",

      "content": "In the summer of 2021, our association successfully applied for the allocation of the Potsdam Citizens' Budget and thus enabled the planting of over a hundred fruit trees (mainly old varieties) in public institutions and private gardens. The allocated project budget of 5000 euros was spent almost exclusively on the purchase of trees. With this action we started an attempt to increase the number of trees in our city. Against the background that tree felling in Potsdam is by far not sufficiently compensated by new plantings of city trees, we came up with the idea of giving away native fruit trees to public institutions as well as to private individuals. For our fruit trees planted in youth clubs, children's, school and private gardens, it can be ensured at the same time that the young trees are well cared for and well watered in dry periods. The feedback we received about our campaign was consistently gratifying. The fact of receiving something as a gift, just for a good cause, was met with positive astonishment by many people in Potsdam. Thankfully, some people from Potsdam sent us a photo of the planted fruit trees, so that we can show a small collage here.",

Woods Up supported this action by planting more trees: 4 ash, 1 field maple, 4 Norway maple, 1 copper beech, 1 European beech, 2 elms, 2 hornbeams and a medlar tree for the birds. Today, the cooperation between Woods Up and the municipality of Michendorf has resulted in the beginning of a small educational forest, where children in particular can learn a little more about the diversity of tree species. The plantings were made in the Wilhelmshorst play forest between the primary school, day care centre and crèche. From today on, the children and their families can admire the trees every day and also water them regularly. Thank you for the joint kick-off!",
