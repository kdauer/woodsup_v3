        "topic_1": "For the 4th time, the WoodsUp e.V. team is traveling to Hafnasandur/Iceland from May 6-16, 2024 to plant 35,000 trees in cooperation with the Icelandic State Tree and Soil Agency. The planting material, the contact with the local tree nursery and part of the trees (10,000) will be financed by the Icelandic Forest Service. We are dependent on donations to finance the remaining 25,000 trees. We are financing the travel costs, accommodation and meals privately.",
        "topic_2": "The areas to be planted are previously unused wasteland, which is why it is not simply a matter of converting existing forests, but of genuinely creating additional forest areas. The association is also active in Iceland, where it is possible to recultivate large areas with a very small budget and without bureaucratic hurdles. The fact that no fencing and no irrigation is required due to the regular rainfall is particularly advantageous. In addition, the land in Iceland does not have to be purchased, but remains in public ownership, which ensures that the social bond is maintained in the long term. Icelandic society has a strong interest in supporting reforestation in order to achieve climate protection goals, stop soil erosion and increase biodiversity. The association can also build on the expertise of Icelandic forestry scientists, who have been researching which tree species thrive on the island for decades."
