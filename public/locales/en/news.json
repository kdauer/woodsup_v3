  "topic_2": "At this point first of all a big thank you to all who voted for our project 'planting old fruit trees in Babelsberg, Zentrum Ost and Klein Glienicke'. Now it goes to the implementation. Some trees have already been given to schools, kindergartens and youth clubs, but about 70 trees are still looking for a home. If you live in the corresponding district, have a garden with enough space and would like to take care of a fruit tree, please contact us. The order of allocation of the trees will be based on the receipt of the mails. This message can be forwarded with pleasure. If you are interested, please send a mail to woodsup@posteo.de."
