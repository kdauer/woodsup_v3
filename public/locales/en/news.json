  "topic_1": "Year 2022 is progressing and we are planning our pending projects. In spring we will travel to Iceland the 3rd year in a row to realize the planting of another 40.000 trees. Since there has been a lot of open land on which only a few trees grow since the long-ago large-scale deforestation in Iceland, we see it as sensible to help forest development at this point and to counteract the ongoing soil erosion. Reforest'Action finances the purchase of the seedlings and cuttings, but we will pay all other costs out of our own pockets and are therefore happy about every donation. In this year's autumn we want to actively support the creation of a forest garden/permaculture park in Bosnia. We are also collecting donations to finance this project. However, our very own interest is to promote both reforestation and forest conversion in our region - from monoculture plantations to natural, climate-resistant mixed forests. The biggest problem is finding the areas. Please contact us if you can support this project in any way. Furthermore, we do individual plantings and do take care of them."
