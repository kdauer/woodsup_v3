  "topic_1": "Due to the extreme weather, some seedlings from the last planting season did not manage to grow. Therefore, we will replant 5000 trees on Iceland from September 22 - 26. At the same time we want to use the fall planting to distribute lupine seeds to improve the soil on site.",
  "topic_2": "On October 9th we will have a booth at the Soli Flohmarkt in Freiland! We will tell about our projects and sell delicious food. Come by! All proceeds and donations from this day will go directly to our planting projects.",
  "topic_3":"Autumn attracts many to the forest, whether mushroom picking or long walks through colorful landscape. Again and again we come across pine monocultures, which are sad to see. Why not take acorns, chestnuts, walnuts, hazelnuts or beechnuts with you on your next walk through the forest and put them in the ground."
